# Building Better APIs with TypeScript

TypeScript has revolutionized how we build APIs by providing type safety and better developer experience. In this post, we'll explore best practices for creating robust APIs with TypeScript.

## Why TypeScript for APIs?

TypeScript brings several advantages to API development:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better Documentation**: Types serve as documentation
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and refactoring
- **Easier Maintenance**: Refactoring becomes safer

## Setting Up Your API

Start with a solid foundation:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface CreateUserRequest {
  email: string;
  name: string;
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Define Clear Interfaces
Always define interfaces for your request and response objects.

### 2. Use Enum for Constants
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN = 'admin',
  USER = 'user',
  MODERATOR = 'moderator'
}
```

### 3. Implement Proper Error Handling
Create custom error types for different scenarios.

### 4. Validate Input Data
Use libraries like Zod or Joi for runtime validation.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **Prisma** for database access
- **Zod** for validation
- **Jest** for testing

## Conclusion

TypeScript makes API development more predictable and maintainable. The initial setup investment pays off quickly in reduced bugs and improved developer experience.

Start small, be consistent with your type definitions, and gradually adopt more advanced TypeScript features as your API grows.
